The website will have the following specification:

Show a list of bookmarks
Add new bookmarks
Delete bookmarks
Update bookmarks
Comment on bookmarks
Tag bookmarks into categories
Filter bookmarks by tag
Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks

We'll be using a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) cycle (i.e. outside-in testing: Capybara first).

Throughout this challenge we'll create User Stories based on the specification, and sketch a high-level domain model.
